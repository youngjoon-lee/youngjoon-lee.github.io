      <description>Due to the pandemic, I had worked from home in Berlin, Germany since February 2020. Honestly, I love to work from home and I feel I can concentrate better at home, rather than the office. However, it was full of solitude to stay at home alone for 2 months without meeting anyone. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to come back to Korea and stay here until everything is back to normal.</description>
