      <description>Kubernetes is revolutionizing the way applications are being developed and deployed. Now, developers can focus on implementing the application itself without worrying about the underlying infrastructure and some of distributed system concepts.
However, Kubernetes doesn&amp;rsquo;t support storing state, even though most of applications are stateful.
On Kubernetes, containers can being created and destroyed. They are dynamic. But, persistent storages cannot be dynamic as normal Pods.
Many SW teams have been using distributed storage solutions provided by cloud providers, such as AWS or GCP.</description>

      <description>Given a stream of strings, let&amp;rsquo;s think how to count the number of distinct strings (Cardinality).
Using in-memory data structure The simplest way might be using a in-memory data structure, such as HashSet. Whenever we read a string from the stream, we can add it to the HashSet. Finally, we can return the final size of HashSet.
But, this way needs O(n) of memory at most, if n is the number of strings in the stream.</description>

      <description>Due to the pandemic, I had worked from home in Berlin, Germany since February 2020. Honestly, I love to work from home and I feel I can concentrate better at home, rather than the office. However, it was full of solitude to stay at home alone for 2 months without meeting anyone. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to come back to Korea and stay here until everything is back to normal.</description>
